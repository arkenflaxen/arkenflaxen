                    <p>
                        I’m a recently graduated architect with a background in
                        international logistics and experience in the service
                        industry. I’ve worked in physical planning and developed
                        communication materials for infrastructure projects, as
                        well as on a web-based CAD platform where I honed my
                        skills in floor plan design. During my thesis, I
                        designed and built a floating sauna, overseeing the
                        entire production process. I look forward to using my
                        skills in a collaborative environment and contributing
                        to projects that combine my experience in architecture,
                        planning, and customer interaction.
